Instructions for using the bag file:

Start your roscore. In two separate terminal windows, use:

	$> rosbag play /path/to/bagfile/sensors_2013-08-28-12-52-47.bag

	$> ROS_NAMESPACE=/camera_front_center rosrun image_proc image_proc

Then start aquaros (assuming you have built project and it is in your ROS path) using

	$> rosrun project aquaros

Aside: If you just want to see the video of bag file, instead of running aquaros, you can use:

	$> rosrun image_view image_view image:=camera_front_center/image_rect_color
